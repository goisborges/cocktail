Java cocktail Project

Project created for my Advanced Object Oriented course.
It connects to an API that will retrieve cocktail recipes and show on a friendly GUI created with JavaFx on IntelliJ.

https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

The endpoints were tested using Postman.

There are 2 different views on the project. The first view to search for drinks by category, drink name or ingredient. The list returned shows all the drinks on that search. The user can then select a drink and click on SHOW RECIPE button. It opens a different view with the drink details, including the ingredients and the recipe. The user can go back to the search view by clicking on the BACK button.

The categories list is fecthed and shown dynamically with a specific API call. The cocktail class holds the information from the drink object and is populated after the API call.

For more information, please contact me.

Thanks Professor Jaret Wright for all your hard work and for sharing your knowledge.
